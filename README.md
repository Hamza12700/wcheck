# Wcheck

Wcheck (word-check) is a command-line program to find and search the meaning of
the words using [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/). 

# Features
- Search a word for its definition and example usage
- Find similar spelling or pronunciations words

# Why

More often than not, I'm searching for the meaning of the word because I'm not
a native English speaker and I end-up going to the Cambridge dictionary website
alot. Because I use Linux (BTW), I've my terminal opened the whole time so when
ever I need to look-up a word I just typed that and get exactly what I want
which is meaning/definition of the word and some example sentences.

## Installation:

Clone the repo into your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamza12700/wcheck
```

Use [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to build and install the binary.
```bsah
cd drash
cargo install --path .
```

# Future Plans
- [ ] Support for more websites like: Oxford, Google and more...
- [ ] Cache the results for the searched word
- [ ] Custom response options
